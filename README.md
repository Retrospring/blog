# Blog Posts

This repository does not include the source code to our blog. We use it to schedule/review new posts before publishing them on our write.as page (blog.retrospring.net)

## What's Included

All blog posts can be found in the `posts/` directory in this repository. Posts that have been published should be prefixed with their date in a
`YYYYMMDD` format.

The filename is the published slug of the post on write.as, or  simply the first heading in lower kebab-case.

Ex. `20220130-temporarily-disabling-languages-on-retrospring.md`

## Licence

The blog posts are provided by the Retrospring team to the public under [CC-BY-4.0](./LICENCE).
